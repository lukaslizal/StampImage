  "body": "##Create own patterns\r\nStampImage is tool for easy tiled mosaics creation. Workflow is flexible and super fast. You have real time preview of your work at any point, so you can quickly prototype by changing, erasing, adding or switching each of the mosaic patterns. Each of your pattern tiles is placed to final mosaic based on input image so with one set of pattern tiles you can generate new mosaics with just switching input image for a new one. Oh and you can also save your patterns so you can load and reuse/edit/profit later.\r\n\r\n##How does output look like?\r\nOutput image is a .pdf file. This tool can only generate black and white images and basic building element of mosaic is a square. When exporting .pdf with mosaic you can choose to export image with transparent background instead of white.\r\n\r\n##What should I use this for?\r\nStampImage can be used for a lot of purposes, for a better understanding check out this quick walkthrough:\r\n\r\n![create your own pattern tiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcrexe/StampImage/master/src/visual%20clue/1_Tiles.gif)\r\n![select image on which output mosaic will be based](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcrexe/StampImage/master/src/visual%20clue/2_Input.gif)\r\n![choose size of tiles in mosaic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcrexe/StampImage/master/src/visual%20clue/3_Output1.gif)\r\n![set line offset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcrexe/StampImage/master/src/visual%20clue/4_Output2.gif)\r\n![flip any tile in x or y direction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcrexe/StampImage/master/src/visual%20clue/5_Output3.gif)\r\n\r\n##Examples\r\n\r\n![artwork inspired by Zdeněk Sýkora](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcrexe/StampImage/master/src/examples/Demo2.gif)\r\n![maze](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcrexe/StampImage/master/src/examples/Demo3.gif)\r\n![artwork inspired by Vera Molnar - Letters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcrexe/StampImage/master/src/examples/Demo1.gif)\r\n\r\n##Author\r\nThis software was made in 2015 by Lukáš Lízal (@lukaslizal). Motivation was to create specialized graphic design tool which can do specific tasks smooth and fast.",
